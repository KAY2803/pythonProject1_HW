There are many ways of concatenating lists in Python.
Specifically, in this article, we'll be going over how to concatenate two lists in Python using the plus operator,
unpack operator, multiply operator, manual for loop concatenation, the itertools.chain() function and
the inbuilt list method extend().
This method allows you to join multiple lists.
It is a fairly new feature and only available from Python 3.6+.
The unpacking operator, as the name implies, unpacks an iterable object into its elements.
Unpacking is useful when we want to generate a plethora of arguments from a single list.
The multiply (*) operator is special case of list concatenation in Python.
It is used to repeat a whole list multiple times (which is why it's denoted with a multiplication operator):
In this method we will go through one list while appending each of its elements to another list one by one.
When the loop is over you will have a single list with all the desired elements:
